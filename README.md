# The UI tools for AREG SDK

## Introduction

[AREG](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk) is an interface-centric communication engine. The AREG SDK consists of communication engine and the multiple tools. Since AREG engine is interface-centric, i.e. it works with predefined interfaces, there is a need to craete GUI tool do desing at least interface and servicing components. This project is a GUI tool to desing ad visualize service interface files used by code generator to create source codes based on technology provided by AREG engine. It also collects the logs from multiple instances in the live real-time mode. It opens and displays logging files for further anlyzes. The logging have filters and searching features. To be albe to use logging, the applications should be build using `areg` library. The `logcollector` process should start as a service or console application and the `lusan.init` file should be configured to connect to log collector.

## How to clone

The AREG SDK tool application is base on Qt6 thirdparty libraries.

```bash
# Step 1: Create areg-sdk-tool directory, can be any name
$ mkdir areg-sdk-tools

# Step 2: Switch to that direcotory
$ cd ./areg-sdk-tools

# Step 3: Clone recursevely all sources, including dependencies that has availonia
$ git clone https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk-tools.git .
```

## Software build

**System Requirement**:
1. Qt6.8.1 or newer;
2. QtCreator 15 or newer;
3. CMake 3.20 or newer;
4. One of compilers:
   - GCC or CLang compilers under Linux.
   - MSVC compilers under Windows.

To build the software, you'd need Qt6.8 and the QtCreator IDE. Open `areg-sdk-tool` in the QtCreator => select Kit Configuration => run CMake => build application.

> [!NOTE]
> The detailed instruction to build the project with or withoud QtCreator will be update later.

## Tools included

This UI Tool for AREG SDK includes following applications:
1. Service Interface designer;
2. Multiple instance log viewer and log analyzer with filters.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ðŸ’¡ This project is under development, some features may be incomplete or contain bugs. Currently it is possible to make `Service Interface` document design, live real-time and offline multiple instance logging with filtering by priorities. If you find a bug or have better idea for the features, please create a ticket. Welcome to join the project. You may as well pick up any unassigned ticket you'd like to fix. Write a short message in the ticket before working on it. Feel free to ask questions.
